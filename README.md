# Airbnb Price Prediction Application

### The Problem
Using machine learning models (linear regression, random forest, xgboost) to predict NYC Airbnb price and understand some of the key driving factors behind the pricing of any given listing.

### Hosting Application
Out team will be utilizing flask app and html to host data and deploy to Heroku.

### Preprocessing/Data Cleaning
Our group will work in Jupyter Notebook to complete any preprocessing and data cleaning that is needed before training and testing each model.

### Model Testing/Selection
Our group will train and test 3 different models stated above to predict the price of Airbnb listings in the NYC area.
We will be using variables listed below in testing models:
* Borough Type: One of the 5 boroughs of NYC
* Room Type: Entire Home/Apt, Private, or Shared Room
* Reviews per Month: Ranges from 0 to 5 that represents how many reviews were left on Airbnb app
* Availability in a Year: Ranges from 0 to 365 that represents how many days is the location available for use

### Data Visualization
Our team will also use Tableau to visualize our findings during the exploration of the model testing/selection process.
